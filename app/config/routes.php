	/**
	* This file contains the configuration of your routes that is to say that links to your URLs.
	* The index of the $route array contains the url address to capture and the value contains 
	* the name of the module, controller and the method to call.
	* For example :
	*
	* $route['/users/login'] = 'moduleUsers#UsersController@login_action';
	*
	* it means, if the user type in the address bar an URL like http://yoursite.com/users/login, 
	* that will call the module "moduleUsers", the controller "UsersController" and the method "login_action".
	* Note 1: it is recommended that each index in the $route array start with a slash "/" 
	* otherwise on some system this will not work.
	* Note 2: to define the default controller route (homepage) of your application you use only the index "/" 
	* for example the following route represents the homepage:
	* 
	* $route['/'] = 'Home'; //only the controller or module name
	*
	* $route['/'] = 'Home@index'; //only the controller or module name with the method
	*
	* $route['/'] = 'module#Home@index'; //with module name, controller and method
	*
	* Note 3: If the method is not specified then the "index" method will be used as 
	* default method. For example in the case of our homepage, this will be able to make:
	* 
	* $route['/'] = 'Home';
	*
	* Note 4: All methods called must have "public" visibility if you know the principle of 
	* Object Oriented Programming, you know what visibility means (public, protected, private).
	*
	* In the index of your route, you can use the markers (:num), (:alpha), (:alnum) and (:any) which correspond 
	* respectively to the regular expression [0-9], [a-zA-Z], [a-zA-Z0-9] and. *.
	* For example :
	*
	* - $route['/profile/(:num)'] = 'UsersController@profile'; => http://yoursite.com/profile/4 will be captured but 
	* http://yoursite.com/profile/a will not captured.
	*
	* - $route['/profile/(:alpha)'] = 'UsersController@profile'; => http://yoursite.com/profile/a will be captured 
	* but http://yoursite.com/profile/1457 will not captured.
	*
	* - $route['/profile/(:alnum)'] = 'UsersController@profile'; => http://yoursite.com/profile/4a, 
	* http://yoursite.com/profile/7 will be captured but http://yoursite.com/profile/7-dangerous will not captured.
	*
	* - $route['/(:any)'] = 'ArticleController@read'; => http://yoursite.com/1-my-super-article, 
	* http://yoursite.com/7, will be captured.
	* 
	* Note 5: The order of definition of each route is important. 
	* For example, the following definitions work:
	*
	* $route['/article/add'] = 'Article@add';
	* $route['article/(:any)'] = 'Article@read';
	*
	* however, the following definitions does not work as intended
	*
	* $route['article/(:any)'] = 'Article@read';
	* $route['/article/add'] = 'Article@add';
	*

	/**
	 *  The default route like your home page
	 */
	$route['/'] = 'Home';
	//setting language
	$route['/set_lang/(:alpha)'] = 'Home@set_lang';
